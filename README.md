This project is being created using React.js and I'm planning on using the Wordpress API as a headless CMS.

## React.js
Using React to create independent components and put them together to create the front-end part of the website.

## Wordpress
I'll try to use the Wordpress API with async requests from React. Using the Wordpress admin area to manage the content and React / Wordpress API to show it, as opposed to creating a Wordpress theme.
